# GitHub Repo language prediction Project

### Author: Ryvyn Young & George Arredondo

## Description: 
- For this project, you will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.

## Instructions for Replication

## Research:
- What is base url?
- Get anchor url from topics search?
- HTML tag for readme text?
- HTML tag for language?

## Key Findings



**Best Performing Model**

**Possible Next Steps**

## Planning Stage
Project Description: 
- For this project, you will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.


GOALS:
Can we predict what language is being used based on the README.md documentation


MVP Questions to answer:
- initial dataset is repos on first page of https://github.com/search?o=desc&p=1&q=environmental&s=updated&type=Repositories
- get anchor url for each result 
- 


## Acquire Stage


## Preparation Stage




## Exploration and Pre-Processing Stage



## Modeling Stage


## Delivery Stage
- Jupyter notebook that contains your analysis
- One or two google slides suitable for a general audience that summarize your findings. Include a well-labelled visualization in your slides.
- 5 min presentation
